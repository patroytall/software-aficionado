**Disclaimer**

Eloquence is not a given. My prose is rough and direct; likely incorrect at times. Nuances are skipped for efficiency reasons.

My experience with frontend implementation is minimal. I built this site using [Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Lume](https://lume.land/) to learn about these technologies. Source code is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/patroytall/patrick-roy-me).

Information on this site is based on my years of experience not on in-depth analysis or research. I hope the material helps you in your software development endeavors.
